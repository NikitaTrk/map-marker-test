These are potential next steps that go beyond the test scope but would add value to the project.

---

- Visualize data flow between model and components using a Mermaid diagram
- Add editing and deleting for places via the right-side panel
- Move map configuration (zoom, coordinates) to a centralized config or env file
- Make map instance reactive to enable stream-based logic after initialization
- Show a loader while important data is loading, and handle possible errors
